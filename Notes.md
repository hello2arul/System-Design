### Thin vs Thick client
* In a Thick client architecture, most of the application logic resides on the client device, reducing the server's dependency.
* On the other hand, thin clients delegate most of the processing tasks to the server, with the client primarily responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user input.

### JWT
#### Use Cases
#### Authentication:

1. Login: After a user logs in, the server generates a JWT and sends it to the client.
Subsequent Requests: The client includes the JWT in the Authorization header of each request to authenticate.
